101	Bruised Peaches	Tom	The farthest road I have traveled is the director’s routine.
102	Bruised Peaches	Tom	If the Oscar has an award for the worst movie of the year, then the movie will definitely be nominated.
103	Bruised Peaches	Tom	I understand that this is a sequel the director needs to film, but for the audience it is definitely a bad movie to see.
104	Bruised Peaches	Tom	The story is not bad, at least the main line is smooth and details are clear. Only thing it's I don't the necessity of those supporting roles.
105	Bruised Peaches	Tom	The upgrade of technology can't change the stereotype of concept, and the latter is the key to the success of a movie. If a movie focuses only on stars and special effects, and adopting a laissez-faire attitude to the details of the story, then it's just a bad movie, nothing more.
106	Bruised Peaches	Tom	The director wants to express a lot of things in this film , but in the end just proved his lack of ability.
107	Bruised Peaches	Tom	This movie will definitely not go down in history, nor is it enough to inspire your life. But if you just want to flee the real world for several hours, then this is a good choice.
108	Bruised Peaches	Tom	It takes us on a journey to another world and completely makes it a part of us.
109	Bruised Peaches	Tom	In the first 40 minutes of the film, there was almost no dialogue, no human characters appeared, but it has already produced a poem full of beauty and wisdom.
110	Bruised Peaches	Tom	Such a movie does not require any review. Only thing you need is to feel it with all your heart.
201	Film Info Site	Scott	See the tears in my eyes? It's not out of joyful…
202	Film Info Site	Scott	The director’s understanding of foreshadowing seems to stay at the level of elementary school, not only didn't it play the role of foreshadowing, but also caused premature spoilers, even the purpose of setting a foreshadowing itself has ruined the movie.
203	Film Info Site	Scott	The only comfort from seeing a movie like this is the popcom that comes free with the ticket. It tastes really good. So we suggest everyone, just ignore the movie and enjoy the popcom, it'll be so much fun.
204	Film Info Site	Scott	With or without lines seems has no effect on this movie. Wait, to think about it, cut all the lines off may even make it a better movie.
205	Film Info Site	Scott	I can only say that the idea of ​​the movie is good, but in the end it did not express anything with deeper meaning. Perfectly confirmed that there's a huge gap between idea and reality.
206	Film Info Site	Scott	I don't know how to evaluate this movie, it is a failure as a movie, but it succeeded in amusing me with its own stupidity.
207	Film Info Site	Scott	Well it's nice compared to other movies on showing in the same time. It makes people believe in love... sorry, believe in the movie industries again.
208	Film Info Site	Scott	Don't let the luxury cast fools you! This is a total piece of…masterpiece! The lens clips are just right, the plot conflicts are arranged reasonably, and it’s absolutely unforgettable! The only question is, when will the director take a sequel?
209	Film Info Site	Scott	I'm lucky to be able to see this movie in my life.
210	Film Info Site	Scott	A real art, each component is carefully designed and carved by true artists, so it can't be changed a bit, otherwise, it is no longer the same piece of art.
301	PeopleReview	Jack	This can't even be called a movie. My childhood diary is more fun to look at than this.
302	PeopleReview	Jack	As a movie, the advertisements contained in it is too much. I feel that I have watched the advertising highlights for two hours.
303	PeopleReview	Jack	The actor's performance is okay, but the director is not.
304	PeopleReview	Jack	Good looking actors with beautiful scenes, makes you want to go travel. Say no more, I'm checking flights now.
305	PeopleReview	Jack	It seems impossible to sum up what the movie wants to express, and there is no core spirit. We know it's hard to make it deep in a 2-hour movie, but it should always reflect something, such as the establishment of some values, a spiritual lead, or a feeling, but we see nither of these thing in this movie. It's just quiet a mess.
306	PeopleReview	Jack	Magnificent architecture, exotic style, extreme luxury, but besides all these, the inside of this gorgeous shell is pale and powerless. The most attractive point of this movie is probably the actress's cloth. I even got a feeling that I'm seeing a fashion show in Milan rather than a movie.
307	PeopleReview	Jack	Sometimes it feels like watching a stage play, sometimes it feels like watching a moving oil painting, it is just not like watching a movie. The expression technique is a bit exaggerated and does not meet the tastes of contemporary people. I can see that the director has his own ideas, but perhaps he needs to listen to others' opinion too.
308	PeopleReview	Jack	The gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, the music is soothing and sorrowful. Seeing this movie is a total enjoyment. Whenever you see it again, you can have a new feeling.
309	PeopleReview	Jack	Retro restrained shooting techniques with deep emotions, the director has a strong sense of art, which is accurate and elegant, smooth and unobtrusive. Oskar nominated for sure.
310	PeopleReview	Jack	This is a movie that makes people feel "no regrets in this life." If I have a time machine, the first thing I will do is to go back to the moment before I se this movie and then see it again.
