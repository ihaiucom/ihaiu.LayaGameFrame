1	Tom	Except for special effects, I don’t know what else to look at.
2	Jack	Disappointment of the year, I don't know where all the good reviews come from.
3	Mary	The excitement ends when the movie ends.
4	Rose	A bad script with no substantial content is a dead wood.
5	Mike	I finished seeing this movie only because of the actress!
6	John	I have no idea what this movie is about, only thing I remember is whose shoulder I leaned on.
7	Judy	The only feeling I got from seeing this movie is awkward…even after reading the reviews I still don't understand.
8	Sam	Seeing this movie is like having a nightmare!
9	Linda	I don't know what's left except for the theme song and that cheap special effect.
10	Tony	The story is bad, conflict is too intentional, the logical support of the occurrence of the whole event is very strange, characters are not vivid.
11	Tom	I guess they spent half of the budget on editing the trailer! All the highlights are in the trailer, no need to see the whole movie at all.
12	Jack	I just want to ask myself again and again, why did I buy the ticket from the very start?
13	Mary	All the characters are so disgusting, all faking and pathetic, there is no sincerity at all.
14	Rose	Even the PPT my boss used in meeting is better than this.
15	Mike	That just hurt my eyes and my heart.
16	John	No one dare to say this is just a worthless piece of junk?
17	Judy	Big ambition, small achievement. Far worse than expected.
18	Sam	The director tried really hard to take my hard-working earned money away by this bullshit.
19	Linda	I'm probably don't want to see any more movies. Ever.
20	Tony	Praise the crew of this fantastic movie!
21	Tom	They say movies are often difficult to transcend literature, but this movie just proved them wrong.
22	Jack	I can think of thousands of better ways to waste my money than buy this ticket.
23	Mary	I am still relishing the lines. Every line is expressed just right.
24	Rose	I don't think they know what they wants to express through this movie.
25	Mike	It takes 7 days for god to creat this world. Why did it takes so long for you to shoot a bad movie like this?
26	John	This is super awkward.
27	Judy	Yeah, another "finding yourself" movie. Not my type.
28	Sam	Everyone thinks it's good. Well it is good in some way, but it's not that good to me.
29	Linda	I've got nothing to say about this movie. Don't even know If we should call it a movie.
30	Tony	Who cares what the movie is about, I just want to see my idol in screen!
31	Tom	Okay we see you're good at special effects, but we want a real MOVIE rather than a collection of effects.
32	Jack	If this is a philosophical discussion, then it's too shallow. If this is a suspense of class contradictions, then it's wrong.
33	Mary	The reviews are even better than the movie itself.
34	Rose	All of my friends think highly of this movie, but I just fall asleep in the middle…Nothing new in the story, just the same old as any other movies
35	Mike	It doesn't touch my heart. At all.
36	John	No surprise seeing this movie. You can guess almost everything right in this movie.
37	Judy	Definitely don't want to see it twice.
38	Sam	This mvie really makes me cry!
39	Linda	Thank god it started raining in the middle of this movie, gove me a perfect reason to not to tolerate it till the end.
40	Tony	Why shoot a 2-hour's movie when you can just tell the whole story in just 5 minutes?
41	Tom	This movie doesn't have the courage to step forward. Everything is still the same with the last one.
42	Jack	The lens language is elegant and charming, the scheduling is smooth and advanced, and everything is impeccably perfect.
43	Mary	Yeah it's okay. Not good, but okay.
44	Rose	I like it! Good story.
45	Mike	Contains grand vigour in small frame, tells a complicated story in a simple script.
46	John	Just average.
47	Judy	Not smooth enough.
48	Sam	I was very touched by this movie, my heart was cold, and the water was salty like tears.
49	Linda	It's raining both outside the cinema and inside my heart.
50	Tony	Although the characters are somewhat facial, there are still some things to express.
51	Tom	Recommended.
52	Jack	Take my breath! And the main actors are soooo handsome!
53	Mary	The story is too fragmented. Though the atmosphere is excellent and the performance is good.
54	Rose	Beyond my expectation.
55	Mike	Well it's not about the story, it's about how you tell the story. I enjoyed this movie, if not for the air conditioner is too cold, it'll be a perfect experience.
56	John	This young director does have some good idea with this movie. Well done.
57	Judy	I have stayed in Mexico for half a month. This movie makes me miss that mexican girl I met here again.
58	Sam	Expressed director’s personal style in terms of film performance skills perfectly.
59	Linda	I like the beginning and the end, but the middle is a bit awkward.
60	Tony	We hold each other when the bgm starts, and I 'll never forget this moment.

72	Jack	Unexpectedly but reasonalble.
73	Mary	My emotions and opinions are constantly flipping and subverting during this 100 minutes!
74	Rose	Simple but deep.
75	Mike	I'm still feeling the emotion after the movie is ended.
76	John	It's unforgettable…oh I mean the girl who leaned on my shoulder to cry.
77	Judy	This is the second time I buy ticket to see it.
78	Sam	Really touching.

82	Jack	Epic.
83	Mary	It's way beyond my imagination.
84	Rose	I can see an Oskar reward coming.
85	Mike	This movie just told everyone that you don't need superstars to shoot a good movie.
